For longer stays in Chiang Mai while working remotely, a Non-Immigrant Visa may be suitable, often requiring proof of employment or enrollment in a Thai language course.

<br>

It's also important to secure health insurance before or upon arrival in Thailand. You can choose between international health insurance plans or local Thai options.

<br>

Beyond standard care, many expats and digital nomads appreciate access to traditional Thai medicine. For specialized treatments unavailable locally, Bangkok is easily accessible. Knowing healthcare is readily available and of good quality offers peace of mind. Access to affordable health insurance is reassuring for longer stays in Thailand.

<br>

### Do I Need Health Insurance as a Digital Nomad in Chiang Mai?

As a digital nomad in Chiang Mai, you need health insurance. Unexpected health issues can lead to significant costs, and while Chiang Mai's cost of living is affordable, medical bills can quickly deplete your budget without it.

Health insurance offers peace of mind, letting you focus on work and enjoy Chiang Mai without healthcare-related financial worries. Northern Thailand offers great healthcare, but it's best to be prepared.

Language barriers can also present challenges, although many locals in tourist areas speak English.
