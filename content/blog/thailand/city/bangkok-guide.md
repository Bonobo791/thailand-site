Within the palace grounds, you'll find Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha), which houses the revered Emerald Buddha statue.

### Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn)
Located on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, Wat Arun is one of Bangkok's most stunning temples. Its distinctive spires or 'prangs' are encrusted with colorful porcelain, and it offers stunning views across the river to the Grand Palace.

Home to the magnificent 46-meter long reclining Buddha, Wat Pho is one of Bangkok's largest and oldest temples. It's also considered the birthplace of traditional Thai massage.
